Triumvi Smartphone App
======================

This provides a way for a phone to see what Triumvi packets are being
received by the gateway.

It is implemented with Cordova, and should run completely offline.


Some rough steps that likely don't work but are close:

```
sudo npm i -g cordova
cordova plugin add
cordova platform android
cordova run android
```
