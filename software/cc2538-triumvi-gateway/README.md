cc2538 Triumvi Receiver
=======================

This receives [Triumvi](https://github.com/lab11/g2) packets collected by an
attached cc2538 and parses them into the `gateway-data` stream.

Copied from [Triumvi Intel Edison scripts](https://github.com/lab11/IntelEdisonGateway/tree/master/Triumvi/rxScript)


Usage
-----

This script requires an attached cc2538, which only the Intel Edison gateway
supports at the moment.

The onboard cc2538 must first be programmed using the binary image and flash
script located [here](https://github.com/lab11/IntelEdisonGateway/tree/master/Triumvi/cc2538/bin).
